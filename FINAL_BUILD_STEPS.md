# StorySage iOS - Final Build Steps

## âœ… All Code Issues Resolved

The following issues have been fixed:
- Removed all references to deleted network files from project.pbxproj
- Added all local implementation files to the project
- Fixed duplicate User struct issue (renamed to LocalUser)
- Removed NetworkError references
- All Swift files should now compile successfully

## ðŸ“‹ Final Steps in Xcode

1. **Open the Project**
   ```bash
   open StorySage.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Clean Derived Data** (Important!)
   - Xcode â†’ Settings â†’ Locations â†’ Derived Data â†’ Delete folder
   - Or manually: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/StorySage-*`

3. **Add Resources Folder**
   - Right-click on StorySage in project navigator
   - Select "Add Files to StorySage..."
   - Navigate to `/Users/efmbpm2/repos/StorySage/iOS/StorySage/Resources`
   - Select the Resources folder
   - **CRITICAL**: Choose "Create folder references" (blue folder icon)
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
   - Add to target: StorySage
   - Click "Add"

4. **Verify Project Structure**
   You should see:
   - âœ… LocalAudioPlayer.swift in Core/Audio
   - âœ… LocalDataProvider.swift in Core/Data
   - âœ… LocalDataManager.swift in Core/Data
   - âœ… CoreDataManager.swift in Core/Data
   - âœ… LocalHomeViewModel.swift in Features/Home
   - âœ… All component files in Shared/Components
   - âœ… Resources folder (blue) with Audio/ and Data/ subfolders

5. **Build the App**
   - Clean Build Folder: â‡§âŒ˜K
   - Build: âŒ˜B

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

The app should build successfully with no errors. You can then run it on the simulator to test the fully offline functionality.

## ðŸ”§ If You Still See Errors

1. Make sure you deleted derived data
2. Restart Xcode
3. Clean build folder again
4. Check that the Resources folder shows as a blue folder reference
5. Verify all files are in the correct groups in the project navigator

## ðŸ“± Testing

Once built successfully:
1. Run on simulator
2. Test story playback
3. Verify all audio plays from bundle
4. Check that progress saves locally
5. Test in Airplane Mode to confirm offline functionality
